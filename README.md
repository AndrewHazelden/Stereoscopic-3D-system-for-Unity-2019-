# Stereoscopic 3D system for Unity 2019 and 2020 with default render + Post Processing Stack v2, URP, and HDRP
I spent thousands of hours in virtual reality with my Stereo3D Zalman passive polarized goggles and LG D2342P monitor.

I love Stereoscopic 3D and don't want to see a mono image in 3D anymore but using drivers like iZ3D, Tridef, Nvidia 3D Vision, etc was always a pain.
All of them have incorrect approaches in settings like Separation/Convergence which valid only for fixed FOV(Field Of View), when FOV is changed then settings no longer valid.
Also there always problems with the not correct depth of shadows, post-process effects, etc, bad profiles for games. I also made fixes and profiles for games in past.

I good understand how Stereoscopic 3D working and made the correct system for Unity.  
Now I using precision Stereo3D in my projects and enjoying it like never.  

Move the `Stereo3D` folder to the Unity `Assets` folder or import `Stereo3D.unitypackage`.  
Just add C# script to any camera and go.  
Tested on Unity 2019 and 2020 with default render + Post Processing Stack v2, URP, and HDRP.  
More info in the script file.  
Enjoy.
