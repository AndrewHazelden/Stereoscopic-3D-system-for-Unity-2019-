# Stereoscopic 3D system for Unity 2019 and 2020 with default render + Post Processing Stack v2, URP, and HDRP

I spent thousands of hours in virtual reality using the horizontal interleaved Stereo3D method with my Zalman polarized glasses and LG D2342P monitor, sometimes more than 12 hours per day without any problems with my eyes. This even more healthy for the eyes as they not holding converge fixed focus on the screen unlike mono image - focus all-time dynamically changes from near to very far on distant objects, same like watching through a window in a reality where eyes relaxing being on parallel axes. :sunglasses:

I love Stereoscopic 3D and don't want to see a mono image of the 3D world on screen anymore, but using drivers like iZ3D, Tridef, Nvidia 3D Vision, etc was always a pain.
All of them have incorrect approaches in settings like Separation/Convergence which valid only for fixed FOV(Field Of View), when FOV is changed then settings no longer valid.
Also there always problems with the not correct depth of shadows, post-process effects, etc, bad profiles for games. I also made fixes and profiles for games in past.

I good understand how Stereoscopic 3D working and made the correct system for Unity.  
Now I using precision Stereo3D in my projects and enjoying it like never.  

Move the `Stereo3D` folder to the Unity `Assets` folder or import `Stereo3D.unitypackage`.  
Just add C# script to any camera and go.  
Tested on Unity 2019 and 2020 with default render + Post Processing Stack v2, URP, and HDRP.  
More info in the script file.  
Enjoy.
